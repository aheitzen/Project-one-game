Project 1: Building a game

Technologies Used: HTML/css/JavaScript/jQuery

Approach Taken: 
1. Completed a wireframe for the front of my game. In the future, I would like to make more complete wireframe of the entire game because I felt lost in a couple of places, and I think having a wireframe for every part of the project would have made things easier. 

2. Created out the basic html/css/some jQuery for the front side of the game, I wanted to be able to do basic functions like flip the card before I started adding other elements. 

3. Added functionality to flip the cards, only if the correct answer was input. Then I created 2 giant objects with two arrays inside of them to incorporate my questions and answers. Then I wrote the functionality to check if the players answer was correct or incorrect based on those objects. I incorporated sweet alerts into this portion to alert the player if they answered the question correctly or incorrectly. Finally I added the logic to make my game a one or two player game and alert the players who the winner is. 

4. Styled my page more with the use of gradients, z-index, and a function that prints multicolored dots to the screen, all of which I have never used before. 

Unsolved Problems: 

1. I would like to implement some kind of draw logic into the game if in 2-player mode both players answer 3 questions right.

2. I would like to make it easier for the user to get the right answer by correcting the case sensitivity issue applied to the answers.
